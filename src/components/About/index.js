            A motivated software engineer, seeking an environment to get stuck
            in to and use my problem solving mindset and skills I have learned
            during my time at School of Code. From previous employments, I have
            developed soft skills that I believe will help me make a difference
            in the tech industry - Communication, Leadership and Adaptability
            are among these.
